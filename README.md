### Useful development tools
* [LiveReload](http://livereload.com) - Updates your in-browser CSS without a full refresh.
* [JSXHint](https://github.com/STRML/JSXHint) - A JS linter that works with JSX syntax. Wraps JSHint.
* [Chrome dev tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools) - In my opinion, the best dev tools for frontend development.

### Important React articles
* [Thinking in React](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html) - Taken from the official docs.
* [Removing User Interface Complexity, or Why React is Awesome](http://jlongster.com/Removing-User-Interface-Complexity,-or-Why-React-is-Awesome) By James Long. Explains why React is different.

### Other important articles
* [Unix as IDE: Building](http://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/unix-as-ide-building/) Explains Makefiles. Part of a brilliant series of articles about replacing your bloated IDE with Unix tools. 

### Very useful React libraries
* [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router) - Abstracts the logic of "which page to show according to the current url". If your app has multiple pages, you should use this.
* [react-bootstrap](https://github.com/rackt/react-router) - Bootstrap widgets as React components. Very useful when using Bootstrap.
* [react-router-bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-router-bootstrap) If you're using the above 2, this one gives a nice integration between them.
