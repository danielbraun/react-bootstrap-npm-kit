# react-bootstrap-npm-kit
A starter kit for React+Bootstrap+NPM+Browserify

## Quick Start
Run `make` to build.
Use a file watcher such as [watch](https://github.com/tj/watch) for convenience.

### Useful development tools
* [LiveReload](http://livereload.com) - Updates your in-browser CSS without a full refresh.
* [JSXHint](https://github.com/STRML/JSXHint) - A JS linter that works with JSX syntax. Wraps JSHint.
* [Chrome dev tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools) - In my opinion, the best dev tools for frontend development.
